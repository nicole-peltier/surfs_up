## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to collect information about the weather to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round. 

## Results
- The mean temperature in June over 7 years was 74.94
- The minimum temperature in June over 7 years was 64.00
- The maximum temperature in June over 7 years was 85.00
- The mean temperature in December over 7 years was 71.04
- The minimum temperature in December over 7 years was 56.00
- The maximum temperature in December over 7 years was 83.00

## Summary
Considering the temperatures in December compared to those in June, the surf and ice cream shop would appear to be sustainable since the average (or mean temperature) is about the same in the two months. The temperature is not drastically different between the two months therefore there one would not believe the sales would be drastically different from one month to another. Two additional queries that could be performed to gather more weather data would be to perform a statistical analysis about percipation for a month in the spring versus a month in the fall and a locations analysis to see if one area in Hawaii rains more often than another.
